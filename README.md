# Messenger Data Analysis
Application to analyse Facebook Messenger data.

I am not a super experienced developer, especially when it comes to Javascript so the code might be a little bit messy.

This project initially started in 2017 as a python script that used a HTML parser to get information from the Facebook download.At the time, HTML was the only Facebook offered their data download. The option to download in JSON now makes analysis a lot easier.

The project was revisited a couple of times in 2018, but not a lot of progress was made.

Finally in mid 2018, I started learning some Javascript and thought that this language would be well suited to that project. Additionally, it would allow me to develop a web-based solution, which would be easier to share than one in Python or C#. One downside was the loss of multi-file analysis. Javascript is limited to analysing 1 conversation at a time, while the other platforms could run through many files at once. This is a small price to pay for all the benefits that come from using JS, though.

Some figures from the original python script:
